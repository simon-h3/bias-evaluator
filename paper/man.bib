ABSTRACT = {In recent times, artificial intelligence (AI) has been generating a significant impact in various industry sectors, which implies that companies must be ready to adjust to this promising start and progress in the direction of sustainability. The objective of this paper was to analyze the industrial sectors impacted by artificial intelligence during the period 2018&ndash;2022. The methodology consisted of applying a quantitative and bibliometric approach to a collection of 164 manuscripts indexed in Scopus with the help of statistical packages such as RStudio version 4.3.0, VOSviewer version 1.6.19, and Microsoft Excel 365. The results indicate that artificial intelligence is having a growing impact in sectors such as technology, finance, healthcare, the environment, and construction. Geographically, the most impacted sectors are in Europe and Asia, while the least impacted are in the Americas, Africa, and Oceania. It is proposed to conduct future research using AI in power quality (PQ), energy storage systems (ESSs) and hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) systems to contribute, firstly, in the transition to a more sustainable economy, followed by a decrease in dependence on fossil fuels. This research contributes to existing knowledge and paves the way for future exploration of qualitative aspects and emerging trends in the field of artificial intelligence influence in industrial sectors.},
